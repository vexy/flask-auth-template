# Authentication gate with Flask & JWT
This repository represents the source code template for micro webserver that provides authentication gate for your protected resources.

It is written in `Python` using `Flask` framework and relies on `JWT` authentication mechanism.  
Some of the provided strategies are to basic/simple for **serious**, production level webserver. Use this template as starting point for more complex projects and requirements.

### JWT based
`JSON Web Tokens` - or [JWT](https://jwt.io/) in short - is the foundation authentication principle used in this template.  
Be sure **not to forget** to encode/decode token generation at your own strategy. Follow code comments for exact place where you could modify or customise this behaviour.

### No database !
DB layer has been **intentionally omitted** to allow space for your own implementation. In present form, the code handles all tokens **in memory**, making the data available only while the server is running. All registration data (as well as tokens) will disappear after the server shut down.
For more convenient mechanism, store your tokens in some form of persistent storage, or reuse them in different way.

### Modularised
Template is designed to support modular structure. Main application modules are stored in `modules` folder. If you need more modules, you can place them inside - as long as they are connected in the main module.

### Different authentication strategies
Presented here is basic HTTP AUTHENTICATION through Authentication field. Note there are **way secure** authentication mechanisms, such as `OAuth`.

### Installation
Before you begin:
```
git clone
cd flask-auth-template
```
Then proceed with installing dependencies:
```bash
# Run prepacked script
$ . install-dependencies.sh
# or
# install manually through pip3
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Starting server
Template will setup and start a server listening on `localhost`. Check the debug output for more information.  

Start the server using:
```bash
python3 main-module.py
# or
# run using startup script
$ . start.sh
```

**:NOTE:** for `MacOS` users:  
There might be a struggle with starting this project, due to known collision of `Python2.xx` and `Python3.xx` coexisting on same platform. The conflict might be manifested as good ol' *"Module Import Error"* no matter which Python you are using.
To solve this, you might have to "fix" (play around with) your `PYTHONPATH`.  Check out this [article](https://bic-berkeley.github.io/psych-214-fall-2016/using_pythonpath.html) for more information.

#### Word of wisdom
If you ever get stuck remember that `sudo` is your friend. If it doesn't help, start thinking how one cold üç∫ can magically improve your understanding of the üåé.
